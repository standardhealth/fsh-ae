# SHR™: Standard Health Record

![Standard Health Record (SHR)](shr-logo.png)

SHR™ (short for Standard Health Record) is an initiative intended to assemble a core set of structured data elements for electronic health records.

The **Standard Health Record (SHR) Adverse Events Implementation Guide (IG)** is a work-in-progress specification, primarily driven by the CodeX iCAREdata and FDA sponsored project to demonstrate the use of mCODE in the reporting of adverse events using the [Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)](https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm).
